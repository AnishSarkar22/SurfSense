# SurfSense
While tools like NotebookLM and Perplexity are impressive and highly effective for conducting research on any topic/query, SurfSense elevates this capability by integrating with your personal knowledge base. It is a highly customizable AI research agent, connected to external sources such as search engines (Tavily), Slack, Linear, Notion, YouTube, GitHub and more to come.

## FEATURE REQUESTS AND FUTURE


**SurfSense is actively being developed.** While it's not yet production-ready, you can help us speed up the process.

Join the [SurfSense Discord](https://discord.gg/ejRNvftDp9) and help shape the future of SurfSense!



## How to get started?

### PRE-START CHECKS

#### PGVector
Make sure pgvector extension is installed on your machine. Setup Guide https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#installation

#### File Uploading Support
For File uploading you need Unstructured.io API key. You can get it at http://platform.unstructured.io/

#### Auth
SurfSense now only works with Google OAuth. Make sure to set your OAuth Client at https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2 . We need client id and client secret for backend. Make sure to enable people api and add the required scopes under data access (openid, userinfo.email, userinfo.profile)

![gauth](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80d60fe5-889b-48a6-b947-200fdaf544c1)

#### LLM Observability
One easy way to observe SurfSense Researcher Agent is to use LangSmith. Get its API KEY from https://smith.langchain.com/

**Open AI LLMS**
![openai_langraph](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1f4c7a1-0a66-4d21-9053-2e09a5634f95)


**Ollama LLMS**
![ollama_langgraph](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b6c870e-095c-4368-86e6-f7488e0fca28)


#### Crawler Support
SurfSense currently uses [Firecrawl.py](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) right now. Playwright crawler support will be added soon. 


## Quick Start

### Preferred Method: Docker Setup
The recommended way to run SurfSense is using Docker, which ensures consistent environment across different systems.

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. Follow the detailed instructions in our [Docker Setup Guide](DOCKER_SETUP.md)

```bash
# Start all services with one command
docker-compose up --build
```

---
### Alternative: Manual Setup

### Backend (./surfsense_backend)
This is the core of SurfSense. Before we begin let's look at `.env` variables' that we need to successfully setup SurfSense.

|ENV VARIABLE|DESCRIPTION|
|--|--|
| DATABASE_URL| Your PostgreSQL database connection string. Eg. `postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/surfsense`|
| SECRET_KEY| JWT Secret key used for authentication. Should be a secure random string. Eg. `SURFSENSE_SECRET_KEY_123456789`|
| GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID| Google OAuth client ID obtained from Google Cloud Console when setting up OAuth authentication|
| GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET| Google OAuth client secret obtained from Google Cloud Console when setting up OAuth authentication|
| NEXT_FRONTEND_URL| URL where your frontend application is hosted. Eg. `http://localhost:3000`|
| EMBEDDING_MODEL| Name of the embedding model to use for vector embeddings. Currently works with Sentence Transformers only. Expect other embeddings soon. Eg. `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1`|
| RERANKERS_MODEL_NAME| Name of the reranker model for search result reranking. Eg. `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2`|
| RERANKERS_MODEL_TYPE| Type of reranker model being used. Eg. `flashrank`|
| FAST_LLM| LiteLLM routed Smaller, faster LLM for quick responses. Eg. `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `ollama/deepseek-r1:8b`|
| STRATEGIC_LLM| LiteLLM routed  Advanced LLM for complex reasoning tasks. Eg. `openai/gpt-4o`, `ollama/gemma3:12b`|
| LONG_CONTEXT_LLM| LiteLLM routed  LLM capable of handling longer context windows. Eg. `gemini/gemini-2.0-flash`, `ollama/deepseek-r1:8b`|
| UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY| API key for Unstructured.io service for document parsing|
| FIRECRAWL_API_KEY| API key for Firecrawl service for web crawling and data extraction|

IMPORTANT: Since LLM calls are routed through LiteLLM make sure to include API keys of LLM models you are using. For example if you used `openai/gpt-4o` make sure to include OpenAI API Key `OPENAI_API_KEY` or if you use `gemini/gemini-2.0-flash` then you include `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

You can also integrate any LLM just follow this https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers

Now once you have everything let's proceed to run SurfSense. 
1. Install `uv` : https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
2. Now just run this command to install dependencies i.e `uv sync`
3. That's it. Now just run the `main.py` file using `uv run main.py`. You can also optionally pass `--reload` as an argument to enable hot reloading.
4. If everything worked fine you should see screen like this.

### FrontEnd (./surfsense_web)

For local frontend setup just fill out the `.env` file of frontend.

|ENV VARIABLE|DESCRIPTION|
|--|--|
| NEXT_PUBLIC_FASTAPI_BACKEND_URL | Give hosted backend url here. Eg. `http://localhost:8000`|

1. Now install dependencies using `pnpm install`
2. Run it using `pnpm run dev`

You should see your Next.js frontend running at `localhost:3000`
