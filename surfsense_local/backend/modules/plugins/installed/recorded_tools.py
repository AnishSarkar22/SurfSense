"""Record what a connected plugin's source lists, applying the rule for tools added later.

At connect every tool starts on: the user reviewed the plugin then. After that a server
can change any day, so a new tool starts off, a tool whose description changes or whose
annotations become less safe is switched off, and a removed tool disappears.
