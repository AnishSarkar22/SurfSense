/**
 * Rendered in the site design: the palette, ruled column, navigation and
 * footer all come from `app/(home)/layout.tsx`; the page itself is Tailwind
 * plus the shared `siteText` styles. Listed in `SITE_DESIGN_ROUTES` in
 * `components/site/site-shell.tsx`.
 *
 * This page does one thing: send a licence file back to the address it was
 * issued to. Without accounts, that file is the only thing a customer holds,
 * so losing it has no other recovery path -- which is why `/license/success`
 * points here three times and `scripts/correct_license_email.py` hands the
 * customer back to it after a support fix.
 *
 * The trial form used to sit above this one. It now lives on `/downloads`,
 * where the 30-day licence is claimed alongside the installer it needs.
 *
 * The explanatory blocks the first version ran as plain paragraphs are FAQ
 * content in substance, so they render as the same native `<details>`
 * accordion the homepage, pricing and plugins pages use.
