 * The one place the activation steps live. All three license emails link here
 * (`app/license/email/message.py`), as do `/license` and `/license/success`,
 * which used to carry their own prose copy of the same instruction.
 *
 * Indexed, unlike its siblings: `/license` and `/license/success` are noindex
 * because one is a form keyed on an email address and the other serves a
 * license file. This page is a help document with neither.
